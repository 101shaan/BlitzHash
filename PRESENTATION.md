# ⚡ BlitzHash: Exploring the Limits of Speed in Hashing

---

## 🧩 What Problem Do Hashes Solve?

Every digital system needs a quick way to **recognize data**.

If you’ve ever:
- Uploaded a file and your computer said “this file already exists,”  
- Downloaded something and it verified “100% complete,”  
- Used Google Drive or GitHub and it instantly spotted file changes —

you’ve already used hashing.

A **hash function** turns any piece of data — a photo, a document, a video — into a short, unique *digital fingerprint*.  
If the data changes *at all*, the fingerprint completely changes.

That means computers can:
- Instantly tell if two files are identical  
- Detect corruption or tampering  
- Organize and index data efficiently  
- Avoid storing duplicates  

Hashes are the unsung backbone of how computers **keep track of data**.

## 🎯 The Challenge

There are two broad types of hash functions:

| Type | Goal | Example | Speed |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| **Cryptographic** | Designed for *security* (resist tampering or forgery) | SHA-256, SHA-3 | ~0.8 GB/s |
| **Non-cryptographic** | Designed for *speed* (handle huge data efficiently) | xxHash, MurmurHash, CityHash | 5–15 GB/s |

**BlitzHash** belongs to the *second* category.

The question I wanted to explore:
> *How fast can we make a hash function on modern hardware while keeping it reliable and consistent?*

## 🚀 The Result

BlitzHash pushes the limits of CPU performance:

- **Language:** Rust (low-level control + memory safety)
- **Output size:** 256 bits (same format as SHA-256)
- **Throughput:** **17 GB/s**
- **Speedup:** **7.52× faster than SHA-256**
- **Category:** Non-cryptographic (optimized for speed, not encryption)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

To reach that speed, BlitzHash uses:
- **SIMD parallelism:** processing multiple chunks at once  
- **Cache-aware design:** keeping hot data in CPU memory  
- **Instruction-level parallelism:** overlapping operations efficiently  
- **Branchless logic:** reducing CPU stalls  

The result isn’t “less secure” — it’s *a different tool entirely*, designed for a different job.

## 💡 Why It Matters

Most hashing in the real world isn’t about encryption — it’s about **keeping systems fast and organized**.

| Use case | Why hashing helps | Example |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| File deduplication | Instantly detect identical files | Google Drive, Dropbox |
| Version control | Track file changes | Git |
| Database indexing | Quickly find data | SQL/NoSQL systems |
| Network routing | Balance traffic efficiently | Web servers |
| Integrity checks | Detect corruption | File downloads, installers |

BlitzHash is designed for exactly these kinds of **everyday high-performance systems** — where security isn’t the issue, but *speed and scale* are everything.

---

## 🔐 The Analogy

Think of hashing like **locks**:
- A **bank vault lock** (SHA-256) is secure but slow.
- A **gym locker lock** (BlitzHash) is fast and easy.

You don’t need a bank vault to store your gym shoes —  
and you don’t need cryptographic security to check if two files are the same.

## 🗣️ If Someone Asks “Why Not Just Use SHA-256?”

> “Because SHA-256 is for security — stopping hackers, forging signatures, protecting passwords.
>
> But in most real systems, data isn’t under attack. What matters is **speed** — how fast can we process and identify massive amounts of information.
>
> BlitzHash explores that performance frontier, similar to how Google built CityHash and Facebook built xxHash for their systems.”

## 🧾 Summary

**BlitzHash** is a **performance engineering project** exploring how fast a modern CPU can hash data while staying consistent and reliable.

It’s not about cryptography —  
it’s about **data efficiency, optimization, and raw speed**.
